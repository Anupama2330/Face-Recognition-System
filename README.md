# Face-Recognition-System
This project has two parts namely the face data collection part and face recognition part. In first part, frames are captured using the webcam and haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml file detects the face in the frame. This detected face is stored as a numpy file by the name of the person whose face is captured. In second part, frames are captures using the webcam and faces are detected in these frames similarly. Now, these faces are compared with the stored faces in form of numpy files using K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm. The closest match file's name is displayed and the face is recognised. Model for frontal face detection. Tech Stack - Python, ML(KNN), OpenCV.
